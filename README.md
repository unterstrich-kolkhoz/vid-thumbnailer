# vid-thumbnailer

Wherein lies a microservice that creates GIF thumbnails from videos, given to
it by URLs. It is simple to configure and easy to use, and strives to just work.

## Install

You can install it by issuing `go get github.com/unterstrich-kolkhoz/vid-thumbnailer`. But
beware: it requires ffmpeg!

## Configure

The binary needs a configuration file to work. By default, thumbnailer searches
for a file named `./etc/vid-thumbnailer/server.conf`, but this can be changed by
supplying the `-config` flag.

The configuration can be in one of four directories, namely:

```
./<name>
/<name>
./<name>.local.conf (the first .conf will be replaced)
/<name>.local.conf  (same here)
```

It can also be split up, in which case all matching files will be merged, in
the precedence order above.

## Test

The image resizing part is tested, the uploading to S3 part is not—at least not
through unit tests! PRs very welcome!

Have fun!
